  The data found above contains the crosswalks for each Census wave linked to every other (1850-1940). There are 36 crosswalks in total, representing every combination of Census years<sup>1</sup>. 

  The crosswalks also give users the option to select the linking method with which matches were created. Users can then merge into these crosswalks a wide set of individual- and household-level variables provided publicly by <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>, thereby creating a historical longitudinal dataset for analysis.

  In the above menu, "starting year" refers to one particular wave of the Census and "final year" refers to another wave of the Census.

  For instance, if you choose 1900 as your starting year and 1940 as your final year, 
  then the crosswalk will provide you with <i>histids</i> of individuals in 1900 
  matched to <i>histids</i> of individuals in 1940.  You will then be able to download 
  the data (in .dta and .csv formats), codes used to create the crosswalks, and 
  further codes that will allow you to merge in information from IPUMS and to 
  reweight the data. Extensive documentation is provided and should be consulted 
  before using the data.

  <sup>1</sup> Note: Crosswalks with 1880 data will be added as soon as stable histids are made available. 
  The microdata for the 1890 Census is no longer extant.
